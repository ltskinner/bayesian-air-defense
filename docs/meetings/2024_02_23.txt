- we want the last sentence to pop a little more
    - need more bang
    - what did we actually produce
- is the combination of sensors
    - doing it with bayesian networks, is better than ... ?
    why is this combination (thru bayesian networks)
    better than another way?
    compared to doing it in some other way with some other alg
- convert images into latex graph objects
- save the original versions
    - keep every revision
    - this is ABSTRACT_vSPIE.docx

Marc:
- will convert figure 5 into latex graph objects
    - tkz package?
    - want the picture by itself to clearly communicate


Focus:

We have authored a more effective application of bayesian networks to the
target and intent classification problem

This is an exploding {area of interest}
but now, we can apply more advanced tooling that fall into AI/ML
in that vein, one of the tools that exists that falls into the background as "old"
but this actually gives us the ability to
provide value over

The reason we are choosing bayesian networks is because compared
to other approaches, it is a black box, and we can understand why
the results are being attained

Which provides us intense value in the realm of air defense
because we need explainability

Now the idea of using bayes nets is not new
*we give our review of why, and background of what other people have tried*
From there, we go into our method

The end of the paper is explaining why this was benefitial and what was
accomplished, compared to what has been done before


-----------------------
P1: why bayesian networks are interesting?
why bayesian networks
    - well known, understood
    - not black box - explainable
    - can encode all sorts of info even without tons of data

P2: what has already been done? whats our delta and value add?
- what were gonna do thats different is {}
- with the research that weve done:
    - what are we hoping to show that has not been done
    - what part of that were we actually able to do


---- Conclusion
Compare
    - fuse together, create robust an fault tolerant system
    - is this a new thing?
        - if so, where did others fail where we have succeeded?
        - if other papers were successful
            - what makes ours different
            - and why would someone choose ours over theirs?
            --> the answer to this will drive how we reformat the last sentence



What are we really doing here?
What is it were trying to tell people?

figure out what it is that best differentiates from other work before?
Think of 2-3
    - data fusion
        - measurements
        - knowledge
        - multi-system
        - "dynamic" and "modular" - pick good "boldable" words
    - explainable reasoning
    - concise, clear, powerful
Then well pick
