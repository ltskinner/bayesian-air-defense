
Action Items:

- drop 55555
    - replace with: fusion of sensor systems for decision making
    - multiple disparate sensors
    - application of known mathematical concept that produces futuristic results
        - without incurring overhead of huge nns and lack of explainability
    - we pick air defense to prove viability
- Abstract:
    - send to several SMEs
    - need to make sure releasable - check with Comms
- put the figure from the tex file and put it in the paper
    - https://tikz.dev/tikz-shapes
- take template and create sub-figures

"disparate sensor system into intelligeble product"

We need an abstract punchline that actually matches whats in the paper

"demonstrated feasibility - that it can be done"
"and then make easily defendable observations about what ive done"

- modern
- new
- intuitive
- easy

motivation:
evolve a way to fuse sensor information

solution:
bayesian networks (are)
- flexible
- easy
- lightweight
- well understood
- ubiquitous across languages and frameworks
- ability to do and solve many problems trying to do with AI
- do some things we cant do with newer generation AI systems
    - track back thru impact, breakdowns
    - impossible logical leaps

"weve opened a door to using something that has been overlooked
- we dont need gun for something we can use a hammer for
- with hammer we can actually build something much better"

WE ARE NOT COMPARING AGAINST ANYTHING - WE ARE DEMONSTRATING WHAT WEVE DONE

WE ARE SHOWING THEM AN IDEA:
- you dont need huge NNs to solve these problems

WE NEED TO MAKE SURE THIS HAS NOT BEEN DONE BEFORE
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

"Rushing the abstract is one of the biggest mistakes"


Later:


- With abstract finalized, edit the paper to support our key abstract points
- As editing, identify new figures we want to include
    - comparing bayesian networks to other models
        - computing needs
        - etc
- Well also be thinking about the poster
    - collection of images etc that hammer home the abstract
    - we do have a lot of time for that
    - but we also want to be able to get it to them asap
