## Filled out

- 1. [ ] background **context** -> **general topic** under study -> **specific topic** of research
  - Going into 21st Century Battlespace
  - Stated goals is better sensemaking and interconnectedness
    - "highlighted by the desire for interconnectedness"
    - ooda loops
  - range of legacy and next generation sensors, effectors
- 2. [ ] **central question** or statement of the **problem** your research addresses
  - One domain where this problem is exacerbated is in air defense
    - Where in addition to new sensors and effectors
    - we also see a myriad of threats
- 3. [ ] whats **already known** about this question, what **previous research** has done or shown
  - We know these systems are imperfect and perform better and worse under different conditions
  - Why arent we fusing them all together
- 4. [ ] the main **reason/rationale** for the research, and stated **goals**
  - Bayesian networks have been used up and down the stack for various purposes
  - But not yet been used as a systems integrator between stand alone systems
    - systems that effectively produce the same outputs
- 5. [ ] research and analytical **methods**
  - in this paper we explore the use of bayesian networks
  - to fuse readings of multiple sensor units
  - exposing the network to a range of scenarios
    - in which one or more hypothetical sensors reading is degraded
- 6. [ ] main **findings/results/arguments**
  - we find that
    - bayesian networks are suitable
      - for chaining together N sensors
      - to produce a better reading than any individual unit
      - while taking into account known deficiencies of subsystems
- 7. [ ] significance or implications of findings/arguments
  - like this is sick for air defense
  - but we can also use this for ssa, naval whatever, ground force analysis
