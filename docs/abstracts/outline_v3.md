## Filled out

- 1. [ ] background **context** -> **general topic** under study -> **specific topic** of research
  - defense systems trending toward higher degrees of interconnectedness, with a desire to integrate information from a variety of systems spanning numerous domains.
  - this paradigm has fueld a newfound emphasis on algorithmically driven decision making to augment operators and increased the need for lightweight and high throughput intelligence systems to perform at the edge
- 2. [ ] **central question** or statement of the **problem** your research addresses
  - one domain that is emblemmatic of {whatever this is} is the air defense regime
    - highlighted challenges include the advent of a myriad of threats, requiring highly specialized defense systems spanning legacy and next generation sensor systems, not all of which are designed to be interoperable
  - To ensure high operational impact, the successes of connecting all these systems hinges on the ability to cohesively integrate the operation of legacy and next generation systems on the battlespace.
  - can we fuse multiple disparate sensor systems to support decision making
- 3. [ ] whats **already known** about this question, what **previous research** has done or shown
  - Bayesian networks have been used up an down the stack
    - to perform tracking and identification/classification
  - but, have not been used as a high level systems integrator between disparate systems
  - LLMs and other techniques exist, but have shortcomings
    - computationally expensive
    - limited throughput (especially at the edge)
    - non-explainable
    - lack reasoning
- 4. [ ] the main **reason/rationale** for the research, and stated **goals**
- 5. [ ] research and analytical **methods**
- 6. [ ] main **findings/results/arguments**
  - through our work we find that bayesian networks are a suitable approach for multi-sensor system fusion, and they prove to be an easy to use, flexible, lightweight and explainable tool
- 7. [ ] significance or implications of findings/arguments
  - we find that we can achiueve futuristic results based on known mathematical concepts
    - without incurring the overhead of huge nns and lack of explainability
