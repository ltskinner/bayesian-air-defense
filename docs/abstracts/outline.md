## Filled out

- 1. [ ] background **context** -> **general topic** under study -> **specific topic** of research
  - complex battlespaces with myriad of air threats
- 2. [ ] **central question** or statement of the **problem** your research addresses
  - between improvements of adversarial deception technology, and shortcoming in glue sensors, or even conflicting readings: "v"?
  - deceptive technology and faulty sensor units: how do we reconcile what we are actually looking at, so that we may engage appropriately?
- 3. [ ] whats **already known** about this question, what **previous research** has done or shown
- 4. [ ] the main **reason/rationale** for the research, and stated **goals**
  - There are things we know about the battlespace
  - We should use those things to improve how we interpret sensor readings
  - AND
    - we should use things that we know about the sensors to improve their collective sensemaking ability
- 5. [ ] research and analytical **methods**
  - in this paper we propose
  - bayesian networks
    - sensor reliability
    - object type
    - intent classification
  - with layer to produce CPDs using heuristics and operator knowledge of battlespace
    - human level domain knowledge
- 6. [ ] main **findings/results/arguments**
  - Through this we find bayesian networks to be
  - favorable tools to perform last-mile reasoning over any number of non-explainable black-box type approaches,
    producing more reliable, trustable, and interpretable results than a stand alone sensor units.
- 7. [ ] significance or implications of findings/arguments

In the absence of empirical data to learn cpd values from, we leveraging heurisitcs of the domain space to computing CPD priors
